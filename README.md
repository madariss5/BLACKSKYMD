## Connection System

This bot includes an enhanced connection system specifically designed to work around the "Connection Failure" issues common when running WhatsApp bots in cloud environments. We provide multiple connection methods:

1. **Standard Web Connection**
   - Default connection option with web QR interface
   - Automatically attempts to reconnect with optimized parameters

2. **Specialized QR Generator**
   - Alternative connection method for difficult environments
   - Uses a streamlined approach with fewer dependencies

3. **Terminal-only QR**
   - Most reliable connection method
   - No web interface required, works directly in the terminal

4. **Termux Optimized Connection**
   - Specifically designed for Android Termux environment
   - Reduced memory footprint for better performance on mobile devices
   - Simplified setup process with automatic dependency installation
   - See [TERMUX_GUIDE.md](TERMUX_GUIDE.md) for complete installation instructions

For detailed information about connection options, see [CONNECTION_README.md](CONNECTION_README.md).

## Quick Start

### Option 1: One-Click Quick Connect (Easiest)

```bash
node quick-connect.js
```

This script automatically tries all connection methods sequentially until one works:
- Starts with the standard connection method
- Tries terminal QR if standard fails
- Falls back to browser switching if needed
- Provides clear recommendations if all methods fail

### Option 2: Interactive Connection Tool (Recommended)

```bash
node connect-interactive.js
```

This user-friendly interactive tool provides:
- Auto mode that tries different connection methods until one works
- Easy access to all connection options
- Connection diagnostics and troubleshooting
- Credential management

### Option 3: Simple Connection Helper

```bash
node run-connection.js
```

A simpler interactive script that lets you select different connection methods.

### Option 4: Direct Connection Methods

```bash
# Standard web connection (default)
node src/index.js

# For connection issues, use the web QR generator
node src/qr-generator.js

# For the most reliable connection
node src/terminal-qr.js

# To try different browser configurations automatically
node try-alternate-browser.js

# To check connection status and troubleshoot issues
node check-connection.js
```

### After Connecting

1. Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp app:
   - Go to WhatsApp Settings → Linked Devices
   - Tap on "Link a Device"
   - Scan the QR code shown in the web interface or terminal

2. Once connected, the bot will automatically save credentials for future use
   - You should only need to scan the QR code once
   - Subsequent restarts will use the saved credentials

- **Multi-Tier Reliability**: Cascading fallback system with local files, API endpoints, and CDN direct links
- **Zero Downtime**: Always returns valid content with no 404 errors
- **Ultra-Fast Performance**: Local files serve in <1ms for instant responses
- **All Categories Supported**: Complete coverage for all 15 NSFW categories
- **Error-Resilient Path Handling**: Self-correcting path resolution prevents common errors

For detailed information, see [NSFW_LOCAL_FALLBACK_SYSTEM.md](NSFW_LOCAL_FALLBACK_SYSTEM.md)

## Important Notes

- WhatsApp may occasionally reject connections from cloud providers
- The connection system will automatically try different approaches
- If all methods fail, WhatsApp servers may be temporarily blocking the IP address
